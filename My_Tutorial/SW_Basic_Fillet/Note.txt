1. Centerpoint arc for arc + midpoint line for connecting endpoints
2. ctrl + two edges to add relations (collinear)
3. Draft feature to taper the face to draft 
4. face fillet -> constant size fillet -> constant size fillet (asymmetric) -> variable size fillet (tangent propagation)
5. mirror feature -> select right plane -> select the body to mirror 
6. Design Library tab on the task pane -> feature\metric\keyways -> link to libray part -> right clicck (edit in context)
   -> right click keyway (edit feature) -> blind -> depth 5 

A library feature is a frequently used feature, or combination of features, 
that you create once and then save in a library for future use.
The SOLIDWORKS software comes with several pre-made library features in the Design Library. 
Here, you insert a keyway.
