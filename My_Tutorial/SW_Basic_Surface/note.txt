1. Surfaces are a type of geometry with zero thickness. insert-> surfaces -> extrudes/revolves/sweeps/trim/untrim/knit
2. lofted surface -> tangent length = 0.5
3. swept surface -> guide line
4. split lines (insert->cruve->split lines) tool divides a face into multiple faces
   -> prokection 
5. lofted surface -> Tangency to Face
6. Join the surfaces you created with lofts and sweeps using the knit command 
    knit surface (surface toolbar) -> Expand Surface Bodies  in the FeatureManager design tree. 
    -> Select all the surface bodies in the folder for Surfaces and Faces to Knit
       (The Surface Bodies  folder now holds a single surface body.)
7. Fill each side of the area enclosed between the base, the grip, and the exit nozzle using the Filled Surface tool.
   Constraint Curves allow you to add slope control to the patch. 
   Filled surface (Surface toolbar) -> Select an edge, right-click and choose Select Open Loop for Patch Boundaries 
                                       (Select Open Loop finds all the edges in a closed loop, creating the surface fill.)
   -> Click in Constraint Curves , and select Pull Point1 -> Under Options, select Fix up boundary.
8. planar surface to close the openings on the grip and the exit nozzle
    Planar Surface  (Surfaces toolbar) -> right-click an edge on the grip and choose Select Open Loop.
9. Knit all the surfaces into a single entity
10. Revolved Surface tool to create a surface that extends the nozzle base
11. Move the revolved surface, and position it below the existing nozzle base with the Move/Copy Bodies tool. (under feature toolbar)
12. Use the Mutual option of the Trim Surface tool to remove extraneous faces
    Trim Surface -> Remove selections 
13. Extruded Surface tool, create a trim tool at the base of the nozzle
14.  Move/Copy Bodies -> Under Rotate, click Rotation Reference -> Select Rotation Reference
15. Delete the surface extrude and the surface body created with the move copy tool.
    Delete/Keep Body(Feature toolbar) 
16. Untrim Surface tool to patch one of the surface cuts
    The Untrim Surface tool extends an existing surface along its natural boundaries, so you can select any edge from Surface-Trim3. 
    -> Extend edges. -> Merge with original. 
17. Thicken the surface model to create a solid model (Feature toolbar)
